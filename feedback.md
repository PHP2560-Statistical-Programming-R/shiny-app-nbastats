### Suggested Changes

- could make design more attractive,  most of app is verbatim display of original data rather than useful transformations
- "Looks good. 
- My project!
- None. 
- The biggest is the run time. I am wondering if there is a way to save the data from previous years so that the data isn't extracted live and just then have it display the output rather than making it do so every time. 
- More analysis.
- consider optimizing for speed - it seemed to run a bit slowly at times, on one of your screens you had to scroll right to see more columns in a very wide table - consider reformatting this because those  - columns might not be seen if a user doesn't know to scroll sideways.
- When I pull the app from github, it let me install the package NBAStats and other packages I didn't install before. Can they find away to install those packages automatically when I run the app? 
- I think the interface can be made more visually appealing
- getting summarized data output rather than a whole databases. 
- maybe more visuals to support the tables
- Some data could be stored into the dataset instead of getting it straight from the website again so the loading time could be reduced.
- Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.
- No recommendations
- Maybe include instructions. 
- They could add more plots to make the data specific.
- N/A
- Instructions?
- N/A
- Nothing it's amazing <3
- A better introduction and more decorations for the app would be better
- There should be a guide explaining the tabs. 
- Use the shiny busy indicator to show the user the app is loading
- none
= The design of the app can be more "sport-like". For example, add some pictures.


## Changes before submitting

- Use the [Shiny Data Table](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/datatables.html) this will clean up your tables and allow users to search more
- Instead of displaying all possible information maybe find a way to let the user choose what is displayed.
- In general adjust the formatting to make it look more refined. 
- Create more of an introduction, perhaps even giving links to places where betting information is stored.
